  === imagecompare ===

  This little tool compares two images using pillow's ImageChops and then converts the differnce to
  black/white and sums up all found differences by summing up the histogram values of the difference
  pixels.

  Taking the difference between a black and a white image of the same size as base a percentage value
  is calculated.

  Check the tests to see example diffs for different scenarios. Don't expect the diff of two jpg images be
  the same for the same images converted to png. Don't do interformat compares (e.g. JPG with PNG).

  Usage:

  == compare images ==

    same = is_equal("image_a.jpg", "image_b.jpg")

    # use the tolerance parameter to allow a certain diff pass as same
    same = is_equal("image_a.jpg", "image_b.jpg", tolerance=2.5)

  == get the diff percentage ==

    percentage = image_diff_percent("image_a.jpg", "image_b.jpg")

    # or work directly with pillow image instances
    image_a = Image.open("image_a.jpg")
    image_b = Image.open("image_b.jpg")
    percentage = image_diff_percent(image_a, image_b)
